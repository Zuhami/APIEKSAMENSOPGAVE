■ Project Overview
A RESTful backend system for managing candidates and skills, built with Java 17, Javalin 6,
Hibernate (JPA), PostgreSQL, Jackson, and Lombok. Implements CRUD operations and a
many-to-many relationship between candidates and skills.

■ Completed User Stories
US-1: Hibernate setup with entities and populator  - Done
US-2: DAO layer with CRUD (Candidate & Skill) - Done
US-3: REST API CRUD endpoints - Done
US-4: Filter candidates by skill category - Done
US-5–8: External API, reports, tests, security – Not implemented

■ Architecture
MVC + DAO + DTO pattern:
config/ – Hibernate & Application setup
controllers/ – REST controllers
daos/ – CRUD logic using JPA
dtos/ – Data Transfer Objects
entities/ – Candidate, Skill
routes/ – Javalin route setup
Main.java – Starts server

■ REST API Endpoints
Base URL: http://localhost:7070/api

GET /candidates – Get all candidates

GET /candidates/{id} – Get candidate by ID

POST /candidates – Create candidate

PUT /candidates/{id} – Update candidate

DELETE /candidates/{id} – Delete candidate

PUT /candidates/{candidateId}/skills/{skillId} – Link skill to candidate

GET /candidates?category={category} – Filter candidates by category

GET /skills – Get all skills

POST /skills – Create skill

PUT /skills/{id} – Update skill

DELETE /skills/{id} – Delete skill


■ Database
PostgreSQL database: candidate_matcher
Many-to-many relation between Candidate and Skill.
Auto-creates tables with hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=create.
Populated via Populate class (.

■■ How to Run
1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running.
2. Run Populate.main() to insert data.
3. Run Main.main() to start the server.
4. Visit http://localhost:7070/api/candidates
5. start using the endpoints in dev.http in ressources in the folder http

■ Summary
Fulfills User Stories 1–4 fully.
Clean modular architecture with DAO and DTO layers.
Ready for future extensions such as external APIs, JWT security, and testing.
